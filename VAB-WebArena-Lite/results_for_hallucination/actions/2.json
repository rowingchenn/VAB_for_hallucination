        "The previous prediction you issued was \"In the screenshot provided, it looks like the page is loading the section where I could invite a new member. There are no available buttons or links to invite members currently visible. I'd need to wait for the page to finish loading to see if any relevant elements appear for inviting Beno\u00eet and Abishek as collaborators. However, the action to refresh or wait for a web page to load is not available for me to perform.\n\nTo proceed, I should check the page for possible interactive elements that would allow inviting members once the loading is complete. As there's no indication of which element corresponds to inviting new members, it is possible the page might need more time to display that option, or there may be a need to interact with another element to bring up the invitation option. Since the observation doesn't provide any actionable elements or text related to inviting collaborators, I am unable to perform any further actions based on the current page state shown in the screenshot.\n\nGiven the limited information and the static nature of the screenshot that does not reflect dynamic page changes, I must report that I am unable to proceed with the task based on the current information available to me. If the page does have an invite option that simply hasn't loaded yet, one potential next step would be to wait for the page to finish loading and then issue an appropriate action. However, as mentioned, waiting for dynamic content to load or refreshing the page are actions I cannot perform. If the user is performing these actions themselves, they should look for a button or link that says \"Invite member\" or similar once the page has fully loaded.\". However, the format was incorrect. Ensure that the action is wrapped inside a pair of ``` and enclose arguments within [] as follows: ```action [arg] ...```.",
