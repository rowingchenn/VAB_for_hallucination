    PEP-compliant type hint sanified (i.e., sanitized) from the passed **root
    type hint** (i.e., possibly PEP-noncompliant type hint annotating the
    parameter or return with the passed name of the passed callable) if this
    hint is reducible *or* this hint as is otherwise (i.e., if this hint is
    irreducible).

    Specifically, this function:

    * If this hint is a **PEP-noncompliant tuple union** (i.e., tuple of one or
      more standard classes and forward references to standard classes):

      * Coerces this tuple union into the equivalent :pep:`484`-compliant
        union.
      * Replaces this tuple union in the ``__annotations__`` dunder tuple of
        this callable with this :pep:`484`-compliant union.
      * Returns this :pep:`484`-compliant union.

    * Else if this hint is already PEP-compliant, preserves and returns this
      hint unmodified as is.
    * Else (i.e., if this hint is neither PEP-compliant nor -noncompliant and
      thus invalid as a type hint), raise an exception.

    Caveats
    ----------
    This function *cannot* be meaningfully memoized, since the passed type hint
    is *not* guaranteed to be cached somewhere. Only functions passed cached
    type hints can be meaningfully memoized. Even if this function *could* be
    meaningfully memoized, there would be no benefit; this function is only
    called once per parameter or return of the currently decorated callable.

    This function is intended to be called *after* all possibly
    :pep:`563`-compliant **deferred type hints** (i.e., type hints persisted as
    evaluatable strings rather than actual type hints) annotating this callable
    if any have been evaluated into actual type hints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Possibly PEP-noncompliant root type hint to be sanified.
    arg_name : str
        Either:

        * If this hint annotates a parameter, the name of that parameter.
        * If this hint annotates the return, ``"return"``.
    bear_call : BeartypeCall
        Decorated callable directly annotated by this hint.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable label prefixing the representation of this object in the
        exception message. Defaults to :data:`EXCEPTION_PLACEHOLDER`.

    Returns
    ----------
    object
        Either:

        * If this hint is PEP-noncompliant, a PEP-compliant type hint converted
          from this hint.
        * If this hint is PEP-compliant, this hint unmodified as is.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintNonpepException
        If this object is neither:

        * A PEP-noncompliant type hint.
        * A supported PEP-compliant type hint.

    # logic elsewhere by transparently converting non-trivial hints (e.g.,
    # numpy.typing.NDArray[...]) into semantically equivalent trivial hints
    # (e.g., beartype validators).
    #
    # Whereas the above coercion permanently persists for the duration of the
    # active Python process (i.e., by replacing the original type hint in the
    # annotations dunder dictionary of this callable), this reduction only
    # temporarily persists for the duration of the current call stack. Why?
    # Because hints explicitly coerced above are assumed to be either:
    # * PEP-noncompliant and thus harmful (in the general sense).
    # * PEP-compliant but semantically deficient and thus equally harmful (in
    #   the general sense).
    #
    # In either case, coerced type hints are generally harmful in *ALL*
    # possible contexts for *ALL* possible consumers (including other competing
    # runtime type-checkers). Reduced type hints, however, are *NOT* harmful in
    # any sense whatsoever; they're simply non-trivial for @beartype to support
    # in their current form and thus temporarily reduced in-memory into a more
    # convenient form for beartype-specific type-checking purposes elsewhere.

'''
**Type hint cache** (i.e., thread-safe cache mapping from the machine-readable
representations of all non-self-cached type hints to those hints).**

This cache caches:

* :pep:`585`-compliant type hints, which do *not* cache themselves.

This cache does *not* cache:

* Type hints declared by the :mod:`typing` module, which implicitly cache
  themselves on subscription thanks to inscrutable metaclass magic.
* :pep:`563`-compliant **deferred type hints** (i.e., type hints persisted as
  evaluable strings rather than actual type hints). Ideally, this cache would
  cache the evaluations of *all* deferred type hints. Sadly, doing so is
  infeasible in the general case due to global and local namespace lookups
  (e.g., ``Dict[str, int]`` only means what you think it means if an
  importation resembling ``from typing import Dict`` preceded that type hint).

Design
--------------
**This dictionary is intentionally thread-safe.** Why? Because this dictionary
is used to modify the ``__attributes__`` dunder variable of arbitrary callables.
Since most of those callables are either module- or class-scoped, that variable
is effectively global. To prevent race conditions between competing threads
contending over that global variable, this dictionary *must* be thread-safe.

This dictionary is intentionally designed as a naive dictionary rather than a
robust LRU cache, for the same reasons that callables accepting hints are
memoized by the :func:`beartype._util.cache.utilcachecall.callable_cached`
rather than the :func:`functools.lru_cache` decorator. Why? Because:

* The number of different type hints instantiated across even worst-case
  codebases is negligible in comparison to the space consumed by those hints.
* The :attr:`sys.modules` dictionary persists strong references to all
  callables declared by previously imported modules. In turn, the
  ``func.__annotations__`` dunder dictionary of each such callable persists
  strong references to all type hints annotating that callable. In turn, these
  two statements imply that type hints are *never* garbage collected but
  instead persisted for the lifetime of the active Python process. Ergo,
  temporarily caching hints in an LRU cache is pointless, as there are *no*
  space savings in dropping stale references to unused hints.
